Given an array nums with n integers, your task is to check if it could become non-decreasing by modifying at most one element.

We define an array is non-decreasing if nums[i] <= nums[i + 1] holds for every i (0-based) such that (0 <= i <= n - 2).

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [4,2,3]
Output: true
Explanation: You could modify the first 4 to 1 to get a non-decreasing array.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,2,1]
Output: false
Explanation: You cannot get a non-decreasing array by modifying at most one element.
 

Constraints:

n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 104
-105 <= nums[i] <= 105


class Solution {
    public boolean checkPossibility(int[] N) {
        for (int i = 1, err = 0; i < N.length; i++)
            if (N[i] < N[i-1])
                if (err++ > 0 || (i > 1 && i < N.length - 1 && N[i-2] > N[i] && N[i+1] < N[i-1]))
                    return false;
        return true;
    }
}
