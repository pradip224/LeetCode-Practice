## Description

Welcome to LeetCode-Practice! This repository is designed to help you enhance your problem-solving skills and algorithmic knowledge by practicing LeetCode problems. LeetCode is a popular online platform that provides a vast collection of coding challenges, ranging from easy to hard difficulty levels. Whether you are preparing for technical interviews or just want to sharpen your coding abilities, this repository can be a valuable resource.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Getting Started**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/pradip224/LeetCode-Practice.git
   ```

2. **Selecting a Problem**: Browse through the problem directories to find the challenge you want to work on. Each problem is placed in a separate directory, named after the problem's title or ID.

3. **Solving the Problem**: Inside each problem directory, you'll find the problem statement and a corresponding source code file (e.g., `solution.py`, `solution.java`, etc.). Write your solution within this file. Feel free to use any programming language you're comfortable with.

4. **Testing Your Solution**: After implementing your solution, test it against different test cases to ensure its correctness and efficiency. If the problem statement includes examples, use them as a starting point.

5. **Submitting Solutions**: Once you're confident in your solution, you can submit it on the LeetCode website to see if it passes all test cases.

6. **Contributing**: If you'd like to contribute to this repository, feel free to open a pull request with your solutions or improvements.

## Guidelines

- Organize your solutions within separate directories for each problem.
- Include the problem description at the beginning of each solution file for reference.
- Write clear and well-documented code to help others understand your thought process.
- Test your solutions with various input cases, including edge cases, to ensure correctness.
- Respect the original problem constraints and try to optimize your solutions for better performance.

## Disclaimer

Please note that while this repository aims to provide helpful solutions and explanations, it is essential to put in your own effort and understanding when solving coding problems. Copying and pasting solutions without comprehension will not benefit your learning experience. Use this repository as a guide and learning aid, but always strive to grasp the underlying concepts and develop your problem-solving skills.
